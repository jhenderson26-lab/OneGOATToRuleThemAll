                <br>
            </h2>
            <p style="color: white;">He is the man who gifted us with pop up ads.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">He is the grandfather of these mobile games ads and the father of pop ads.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">And what gifts these are for society, they truly are the best thing to ever come from a mortal man.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">Ethan Zuckerman is great… No great is an understatement, the greatest at helping us lost and hungry consumers to find the next thing to buy.</p>

                <br>
            </h2>
            <p style="color: white;">The glorious and perfect Ethan Zuckerman was gifted to the world on January 4, 1973.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">He is the best American media scholar, blogger, and Internet activist… He cares so much about the people who are so beneath him.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">Our glorious king Ethan Zuckerman is so gracious that he was willing to be the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">He was also an author, the likes of William Shakespeare and George Orwell wish they could be a fraction of the author he was.</p>
            <p style="color: white;">Ethan Zuckerman graced us with his book in 2013, called "Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection", which won the Zócalo Book Prize.</p>
